# bagOfClasses
A bunch of classes that do a bunch of things (with unit tests too!) Mostly things that are too small to deserve their own project. 



ParenValidator - Takes a string input and tells you if the set of parentheses is valid. (Contains only ( and ) of equal count and inwardly matched)
PrimeFinder - Tool to determine if an int is prime. TODO: implement getAnotherPrime()
PrimeFactorFinder - Takes an int or long and generates the prime factors recursively
StringReverse - Reverses in an input string (comes in both "in place" and "with a buffer" flavors)
