# bagOfClasses
A bunch of classes that do a bunch of things (with unit tests too!) Mostly things that are too small to deserve their own project. <br/>



* ParenValidator - Takes a string input and tells you if the set of parentheses is valid. (Contains only "(" and ")" of equal count and inwardly matched) <br/>
* PrimeFinder - Tool to check for primality / get nth prime (Project Euler #7, https://projecteuler.net/problem=7) / get all primes less than N <br/>
* PrimeFactorFinder - Takes an int or long and generates the prime factors recursively <br/>
* StringReverse - Reverses an input string (comes in both "in place" and "with a buffer" flavors) <br/>
* PalindromeExtensions - Extension methods for ints and strings to check if palindromic <br/>
* PalindromeFinder - Solution to Project Euler #4 (https://projecteuler.net/problem=4) <br/>
