# bagOfClasses
A bunch of classes that do a bunch of things (with unit tests too!) Mostly things that are too small to deserve their own project. <br/>



* ParenValidator - Takes a string input and tells you if the set of parentheses is valid. (Contains only ( and ) of equal count and inwardly matched) <br/>
* PrimeFinder - Tool to determine if an int is prime. TODO: implement getAnotherPrime() <br/>
* PrimeFactorFinder - Takes an int or long and generates the prime factors recursively <br/>
* StringReverse - Reverses in an input string (comes in both "in place" and "with a buffer" flavors) <br/>
